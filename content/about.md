I'm an engineer with deep experience shipping products and systems across a wide set of domains. Here are a few things I've worked on over the years:

* **Data & analytics** - I spent years maintaining an internal fork of Apache Spark, finding some [bugs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-686) and fixing them upstream as well as making (sadly closed-source) changes to the query planner and core engine
* **Streaming systems** - I created and led the team building a fully self-service [streaming platform](https://www.palantir.com/platforms/foundry/streaming/) that was used in production by a major US airline, a manufacturing giant, and government customers for soft realtime applications
* **Computer Vision** - I've built bespoke apps and workflows on top of commercial and open source computer vision algorithms, including fine tuning off the shelf models to recognize novel/rare objects.
* **Infra** - I've stood up Terraform pipelines to automate AWS deployments, built Kubernetes operators to deploy Apache Kafka clusters, wrote observable code and used perf testing tools to speed up hot paths by >1,000x. I also built [this thing](https://blog.palantir.com/lilliput-minified-software-patches-ed4028242a5).
* **Embedded hw/sw** - I built out tooling to flash massive numbers of NVIDIA Tegra devices that were loaded into dozens of aircraft for running various AI processing algorithms in-mission.
* **Space** - Lots of experience in the Space industry, working with massive satellite imagery datasets and building new products in the GIS space. Ran code on a satellite 🚀🛰️ (yes you better believe it was in Rust!)
