> **2023 Update**: I'm the co-founder of [Intrinsic Labs](https://intrinsiclabs.ai/), where we're using novel AI and information retrieval techniques to help SMEs solve problems in critical industries. I'd love to chat about your hardest knowledge worker problems!



I'm an engineer who has deep experience shipping products and systems across a wide set of problem domains. Here are a few things I've worked on over the years:

* **Data & analytics** - I spent years co-maintaining an internal fork of Apache Spark, finding some [bugs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-686) and fixing them upstream as well as making (sadly closed-source) changes to the query planner and core engine
* **Streaming systems** - I led a team in building a self-service data streaming platform that was used in production by a major US airline, a manufacturing giant, and government customers for soft realtime applications
* **Computer Vision** - I've built bespoke apps and workflows on top of commercial and open source computer vision algorithms, including fine tuning off the shelf models to recognize novel/rare objects.
* **Infra** - I've stood up Terraform pipelines to automate AWS deployments, built Kubernetes operators to deploy Apache Kafka clusters, wrote observable code and used perf testing tools to speed up hot paths by >1,000x. I also built [this thing](https://blog.palantir.com/lilliput-minified-software-patches-ed4028242a5).
* **Embedded hw/sw** - I built out tooling to flash massive numbers of NVIDIA Tegra devices that were loaded into dozens of aircraft for running various AI processing algorithms in-mission.
* **Space** - Lots of experience in the Space industry, working with massive satellite imagery datasets and building new products in the GIS space. Ran code on a satellite 🚀🛰️ (yes you better believe it was in Rust!)
